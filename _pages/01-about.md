## Course Outline

### Lecture 1

- Metalecture, preliminary reading materials, website location.
- No lab but make sure that the computers all have (or *can* have) stack
  installed on them.

### Assignment 1

Read Chapter 2 of HPFP and do whatever exercises I choose. These assignments
can't really be corrected, and therefore they will not be graded. You are
expected to do them as preliminaries for the rest of the course. ***Do not
skip them.***

### Lecture 2

- `Char`, `String`, `[]`, and functions that operate on these types.
- Lab: Simple string manipulation questions.

### Assignment 2

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 3

- Looking at existing types, simple data declarations (sum/product types),
  data/type constructors, numeric types, simple typeclasses.
- Lab: exercises from Ch. 4 of HPFP.

### Assignment 3

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 4

- Continued discussion on types: type system, currying (necessary for
  understanding the type constructor `->`), ad-hoc polymorphism, type inference,
  manually constraining types.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 4

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 5

- Detailed look at typeclasses: `Num`, `Eq`, `Ord`, `Enum`, `Show`, `Read`, etc.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 5

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 6

- Functional patterns: pattern matching, anonymous functions, case expressions,
  higher order functions guards, function composition, pointfree style.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 6

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 7

- Recursion, bottom type, examples: factorial, Fibonacci, other more complex
  examples.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 7

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 8

- Detailed discussion of lists: pattern matching, list syntactic sugar,
  transforming/filtering/zipping lists,`fold[l|r]`, `[scanl|r]`, associativity
  of operators and how that affects the folding process, introduction to
  monoids.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 8

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 9

- More detailed look at algebraic datatypes: data/type constructors,
  correspondence between kinds -> types and types -> data, `newtype`,
  higher-kinded types, examples: lists, binary trees, `Maybe`, `Either`.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 9

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 10

- Path to monad satori begins: monoids, semigroups, functors.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 10

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 11

- Applicative and Monad.
- Lab: [TODO]

### Assignment 11

Extension of the lab.

### Lecture 12

- Real applications of Monoid, Functor, Applicative and Monad. Examples of commonplace monads: Reader, State, Parser Combinators. Short discussion of monad transformers.
- Lab: [TODO]
